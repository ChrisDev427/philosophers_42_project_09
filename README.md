# philosophers_42_project_09

The "Philosophers" project at Ã‰cole 42 is a programming exercise that involves implementing the classic dining philosophers problem.
In this problem, several philosophers are seated around a table, each with a fork to their right and left.
The philosophers must alternate between thinking and eating spaghetti, but cannot eat if they do not have two forks.
The project aims to develop skills in concurrent programming, using threads to simulate the philosophers and forks,
and avoiding locking and deadlock issues. Students must also implement a solution to avoid a philosopher's eternal hunger.
